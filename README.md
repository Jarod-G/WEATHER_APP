## API
This app uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/) to fetch real-time weather data.

## Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jarod-G/WEATHER_APP.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd weather_app
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your browser:
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

## Important Note

To use this app, you will need an API key from OpenWeatherMap. After obtaining your free API key:

Open the project files.

Locate the part of the code where the API key is required (const APIKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY'; index.js - line 10). 

Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual API key.

Without a valid API key, the app will not fetch real-time weather data.

## Usage
- Enter the name of a city in the search bar.
- Press the search button to get the latest weather details.
